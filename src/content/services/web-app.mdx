            Fullstack product development for the web is really my bread and

      I work with agile principles and can bring an approach to the software
      development lifecycle that has been seasoned and refined over working in
      the industry for the last decade of my career. I am able to own the
      lifecycle from planning through to deployment and am helpful in
      facilitating product strategy and direction as well, always working with
      an understanding of your problem domain and keeping your customer profiles
      in mind as we iterate on product together. For these projects, I use the
      Phoenix web framework, which allows me to be extremely productive without
      compromising on maintainability and scalability. I always have deep
      experience and understanding with NodeJS if that is a requirement. I'll
      make a product that can scale with you. Whether you're looking for a
      technical cofounder or a hired gun, let's get the conversation rolling and
      see where it leads.

              During this initial discovery phase, the primary goal is to gain
              an understanding of your project and your business as a whole.

              where together we can explore the problem space and you can
              transfer and share all of your knowledge and expertise. We'll
              build a shared language to communicate with and this will end up
              directly informing the structure and design of the actual program.

              During the planning phase, I'll take everything I've learned and
              iterate on a solution architecture for the project. Once we land
              on a high level architecture, we'll move into the next phase of
              agile development cycles.

              Development
            </h3>
            <p>
              Development here is inclusive of development, testing, and
              deployment. We'll work together to decide on a workflow that works
              for you, but the gist will be that we enter a feedback loop where
              I will develop the solution iteratively, presenting progress along
              the way. Each iteration will refine the product over time.
              Ideally, real users begin using the product at some point during
              this phase and feedback can inform the iterations to ensure that
              the right product is being built.
