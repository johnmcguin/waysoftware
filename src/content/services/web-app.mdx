            Fullstack product development for the web is really my bread and
            butter. It's where I like to spend my time and it's where I can
            drive a lot of value.

      I work with agile principles and can bring an approach to the software
      development lifecycle that has been seasoned and refined over working in
      the industry for the last decade of my career. I am able to own the
      lifecycle from planning through to deployment and am helpful in
      facilitating product strategy and direction as well, always working with
      an understanding of your problem domain and keeping your customer profiles
      in mind as we iterate on product together. For these projects, I use the
      Phoenix web framework, which allows me to be extremely productive without
      compromising on maintainability and scalability. I always have deep
      experience and understanding with NodeJS if that is a requirement. I'll
      make a product that can scale with you. Whether you're looking for a
      technical cofounder or a hired gun, let's get the conversation rolling and
      see where it leads.
