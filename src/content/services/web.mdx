    Emphasize page speed and SEO. Cite research on bounce rates and importance
    of these metrics. Insinuate that other platforms (e.g. Shopify, Magento,
    Squarespace) are not as fast and can't deliver on these metrics the same way
    I can.

    Cite ability to subcontract where needed (design, copy writing, marketing,
    etc).

    that as the loading time increases, the bounce rate also increases. This
    directly leads to lost customers and lost business. I think that is
    unacceptable. In the world of website builders such as WordPress, you will
    be hard pressed to find a platform that offers the attention to detail that
    I can offer. With a focus on Core Web Vitals, and delivering an accessible,
    usable website as fast as possible, with SEO best practices, this will
    directly impact your bottom line.
