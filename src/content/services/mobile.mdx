        Modern day JavaScript tooling enables writing JavaScript that builds to
        native targets with near native performance. My tool of choice is React
        Native for this use case. In one codebase, I can build and deploy to
        both Android and iOS app stores. Where React Native falls short, there
        is always the fallback to write native modules in Kotlin and Swift to
        interface with the React Native codebase.
